# lyrics-ai

This is a personal project to combine ai and music.

The goal  would be to have a system that learns from track, songs and lyrics currently available to generate insight and/or generate novel melodies or lyrics.

This is a WIP, but if you happen to stumble upon this and have ideas, tips or the motivation to collaborate, please contact me (see my GH profile)

### Things to do:

- set up a lyrics retriever (one-time job, sort of initialization)
- ideally, set up a system that periodically retrieves new info
- set up training for a model to learn from fetched data (notebook, colab?)
- set up serving of model results (new generated lyrics in the style of one of the available artists?)
